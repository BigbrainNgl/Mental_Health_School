Story! <br><br>

Chara has Bipolar Disorder, this is a full day of an bipolar "episode". <br><br>

The start of the day, the main character (I'll just call Chara), <br>
very groggy and doesn't want to get up. But eventually, <br>
Chara gets used to it and wakes up + goes to school. <br><br>

Chara then goes to school to ace her 1st, 2nd, and third period! <br>
But Chara remembers that she forgot to do a massive project in school <br>
and starts to worry a lot. Chara's evaluation of own self-worth <br>
went down a lot... And by 4th period, she feels very depressed. <br><br>

Then, Chara has to go to lunch, and on Chara's way to lunch, Chara gets <br>
bullied from what used to be Chara's best friend. Chara gets <br>
obviously very angry/sad/confused... <br><br>

Chara stays in this mood for the rest of the classes and Chara's <br>
mood affects the effort put into Chara's classes, the grades decline even <br>
more. Chara's mom sees this and gets angry. <br><br>

: This part is a bit dark <br><br>

Chara gets extremely depressed because of Chara's mom and considers <br>
suicide with a gun in her hand. However, Chara does some thinking and finds out that <br>
it's not worth it. But Chara is still extremely sad nonetheless. <br><br>

Chara thinks about the friend that bullied Chara, and why Chara <br>
deserved it. Chara was bad to her friend earlier in Elementary school <br>
and that's why the friend bullies her. <br><br>

Chara feels ok now, so Chara decides to go and shoot some hoops. <br>
After playing some, Chara feels extremely good about how good/fit she <br>
is and now is extremely energetic. But Chara forgot something... <br>
homework.<br><br>

Chara quickly gains boredom and gains a more of a slower sadder <br>
depression. It may have been slower, but it's presence affected Chara <br>
A lot more.<br><br>

And then sleep, Chara finally gets to sleep in peace. <br>
(Not eternallly don't worry). <br><br>

[The reason this repeats is because bipolar episodes <br>
generally take 1-2 weeks, but that *gun part* only happens once <br>
(If you have Bipolar) -> Please seek help if you haven't already.]
